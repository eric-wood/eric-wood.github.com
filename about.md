Hello! My name is Eric Wood, and this is my website.

I'm an avid coder, guitarist, biker, dog walker, and many other things. I live in the wonderful city of Austin, Texas.

Currently I work as a UI application developer at [Spiceworks](http://spiceworks.com) and practitioner of the dark arts of CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails.

You should check out the stuff I have on my [Github](http://github.com/eric-wood) account.
