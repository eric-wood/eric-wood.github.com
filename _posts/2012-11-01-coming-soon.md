So, I wrote [this](http://ericwood.org/excel2latex) neat little thing a few days ago! If you haven't tried it, you totally should. It essentially just reads in Excel files and converts tables into LaTeX tables. The cool part? It all happens in your browser!

I have a very detailed blog post in the works on how it works. It'll cover the basics of the XLSX format Excel uses, as well as the HTML5 file apis I used and how I extracted the data.

Stay tuned!
