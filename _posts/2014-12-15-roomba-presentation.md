title: Roomba Hacking presentation
---

Sorry for the delay on this!

December 1st I gave a presentation at [austin.rb](http://www.meetup.com/austinrb/) covering the basics of Roomba hacking...in Ruby!

The talk goes over all the work that went into the [Rumba gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/rumba) I've been working on.

If you've ever been interested in pushing bits around at a low level in a high-level language, this is a great starting point. It goes over key concepts like endianness, Array#pack, bitmasking, etc.!

Note that some of these slides are really meant for me to be talking over them. If you have *ANY* questions hit me up!
