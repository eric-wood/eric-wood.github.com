title: SASS presentation!
---

Hey everyone!

I've prepared a presentation going over [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for our Spiceworks "lunch and learn". It covers pretty much all of the different language constructs, and has some cool examples that you might find handy!

Anyways, I've thrown the slides up [here](/presentations/sass.pdf) for those interested...they should be fairly easy to follow without me talking, but hit me up however if you have questions!
