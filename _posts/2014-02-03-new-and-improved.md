After nearly two years, I've finally gotten around to redoing the site!

Keep in mind, this is still a work in progress, so I'll probably keep making changes as I get feedback from friends, but I'm much happier with the way things look now. The old look was written in a very different time in my life, and I've learned so much since then; it's about time my website reflected that.

### Mobile!

This site is now "responsive" in that it will look really good on phones as well as your desktop! Just make your browser window really small if you want to see a taste of that without pulling out your phone.

### What's next?

I want to start using this more regularly to write technical (and non-technical) blog entries. A lot has happened in the last few years, and there's quite a few things I could potentially write about. I think it's about time I started taking advantage of this!

Let me know what you think of the redesign!
