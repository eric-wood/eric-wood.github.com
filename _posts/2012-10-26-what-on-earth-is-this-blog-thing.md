title: What on earth is this blog thing?

That's a really good question. I don't know yet. Mostly, it's a fun little side project and a chance to flex some CSS muscles that have been a bit dormant as of late.

My intention is to write about whatever I think people should know about. It might be an opinion I need to share, or maybe some information on a problem I solved. 

### Technical details
I've been using [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) to host everything for [ericwood.org](http://ericwood.org). The other day I was reading about [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), which pages happens to support. Unlike other blogging things, Jekyll lets me roll my own everything, while taking care of the nasty parts like pagination and templating. This pleases me greatly.

Everything you see here was done from scratch, with the exception of some of the backend things Jekyll takes care of. The footer has a link to the source for this site if you're into that sort of thing.
