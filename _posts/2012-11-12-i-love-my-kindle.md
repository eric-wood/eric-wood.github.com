title: I love my Kindle
---

I've been using my Kindle (the vanilla one) for a while now. What a beautiful device.

Because of my line of work/study, I spend inordinate amounts of time staring at a stupid computer screen. It gets a bit old, especially if I'm trying to read a long article. Backlights are bad for eyes. There's things you can do to reduce eye strain, but in the end it's going to be more comfortable to stare at pieces of paper than it is to stare at a monitor.

This is where my Kindle shines; the display is basically just paper. Now, rather than being glued to my computer, I can take news, articles, and books with me as if I were carrying around a bunch of paperbacks. I'm sure you've already heard this sales pitch before, so I'll spare you.

Really, I just want to talk about a few things I've used to get even more mileage out of my Kindle.

### Tools you should totally look into if you have a Kindle

#### Readability

[Readability](http://readability.com/) is an awesome service. Basically, it extracts articles from websites. Say, for example, you're trying to read something on one of those stupid web-3.0 zomg tech news websites and it's trying to bring down your browser and distract you. You're sick of the bullshit, so you click the Readability browser extension and ask to just have the article.Now you've got a nice, clean copy of the stuff you care about. Awesome.

In addition to the article extraction stuff, Readability is a "bookmarking" service of sorts; you can save articles for later and read them on other devices (iOS, Kindle, etc.) This is the part that lets your Kindle really shine! The browser extension lets you send articles directly to your kindle. 

#### Kindlefeeder

I've just started using this service, and I've been blown away by it. [Kindlefeeder](http://kindlefeeder.com/) is a handy service that takes RSS feeds from different websites and compiles them down into a beautiful eBook that it sends directly to your device.

This works best for blogs; I've found that tech news sites like [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) and [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org) don't work well, since they're really just links to other news sites.
