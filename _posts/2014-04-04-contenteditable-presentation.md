Last night I gave a presentation on contenteditable and rich text editing in web browsers at the [Austin Javascript meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/javascript-austin)! It goes into some gross details on how to fix copy/paste bugs, amongst other things.

Anyways, I've gotten a few requests for my slides, [so here they are](/presentations/contenteditable.pdf)!

Thanks to everyone who came out, it was a lot of fun!
