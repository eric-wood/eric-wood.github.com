      <p>It finally happened!</p>

<p>After neglecting <a href="http://ericwood.org/excel2latex/">excel2latex</a> for a long time, I’ve finally gotten around to adding a few improvements.</p>

<p>Previously, there was no way to select which workbook you wanted to convert; the script defaulted to the first one and ignored all others. This was due to the limited amount of time I had available when working on the project initially (it was a huuuuuuuge hack). A few users pointed out that this really inconvenienced them, so I took a little bit of time today to add that functionality.</p>

<p>Now, when an excel file is dragged onto the page, you get a dropdown box that allows you to switch between the different workbooks. Hooray! Also note that I’ve made it so the contents of the text box get selected when you click on it, saving valuable time.</p>

<p>Thanks a ton to everyone who has been using my silly little hack of a project! I never really imagined anyone but myself taking advantage of it, so seeing the usage stats has been a pleasant surprise! :)</p>

<p>Want to help out with the project? I read every single issue posted to the <a href="https://github.com/eric-wood/excel2latex">Github repository</a>, and really need the feedback…there’s too many edge cases for me to test it fully in my spare time.</p>

      <p>I’ve been using my Kindle (the vanilla one) for a while now. What a beautiful device.</p>

<p>Because of my line of work/study, I spend inordinate amounts of time staring at a stupid computer screen. It gets a bit old, especially if I’m trying to read a long article. Backlights are bad for eyes. There’s things you can do to reduce eye strain, but in the end it’s going to be more comfortable to stare at pieces of paper than it is to stare at a monitor.</p>

<p>This is where my Kindle shines; the display is basically just paper. Now, rather than being glued to my computer, I can take news, articles, and books with me as if I were carrying around a bunch of paperbacks. I’m sure you’ve already heard this sales pitch before, so I’ll spare you.</p>

<p>Really, I just want to talk about a few things I’ve used to get even more mileage out of my Kindle.</p>

<h4 id="readability">Readability</h4>

<p><a href="http://readability.com/">Readability</a> is an awesome service. Basically, it extracts articles from websites. Say, for example, you’re trying to read something on one of those stupid web-3.0 zomg tech news websites and it’s trying to bring down your browser and distract you. You’re sick of the bullshit, so you click the Readability browser extension and ask to just have the article.Now you’ve got a nice, clean copy of the stuff you care about. Awesome.</p>

<p>In addition to the article extraction stuff, Readability is a “bookmarking” service of sorts; you can save articles for later and read them on other devices (iOS, Kindle, etc.) This is the part that lets your Kindle really shine! The browser extension lets you send articles directly to your kindle.</p>

<h4 id="kindlefeeder">Kindlefeeder</h4>

<p>I’ve just started using this service, and I’ve been blown away by it. <a href="http://kindlefeeder.com/">Kindlefeeder</a> is a handy service that takes RSS feeds from different websites and compiles them down into a beautiful eBook that it sends directly to your device.</p>

<p>This works best for blogs; I’ve found that tech news sites like <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> don’t work well, since they’re really just links to other news sites.</p>

      <p>This just in!</p>

<p>You can now leave comments. All &lt; 100 visitors will now be able to leave comments on blog posts. This is a very exciting development, I know :)</p>

<p>So…keep it constructive! I’d love to hear what everyone has to say about things!</p>
