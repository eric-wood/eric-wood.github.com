    <h5 class="post-date">October 31, 2012</h5>
    <div class="post-content">
      <p>The other day I threw <a href='http://ericwood.org/excel2latex'>this</a> together for fun. It&#8217;s a bit of a hack, but there&#8217;s enough going on that it&#8217;s worth writing a little about!</p>

<p>The premise is simple: I&#8217;m writing a lab report in LaTeX, but most of the data I took was in Excel (what can I say, it&#8217;s not bad for calculations&#8230;don&#8217;t judge me). I want to throw a nice LaTeX table into my report but don&#8217;t want to do everything by hand or save it as a CSV file and use a conversion tool.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s where Excel =&#62; LaTeX comes into play! With the fancy new HTML5 file stuffs it&#8217;s possible to parse XLSX files <em>in the browser</em> without having to run any code server-side! All you have to do is grad an XLSX file into the browser and it spews out a LaTeX table. Howcoolisthat?!</p>

<h3 id='xlsx_and_office_open_xml'>XLSX and Office Open XML</h3>

<p>Before we dive into the implementation, lets talk a bit about the XLSX / <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML'>Office Open XML</a> formats.</p>

<p>Microsoft is totally down with the open standards thing, yo. They&#8217;re nice enough to go as far as creating an <a href='http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm'>ECMA standard</a> format for all of their Office apps. Granted, the real formats expand quite a bit on OOXML, but even then they publish how those formats work.</p>

<p>For poking around purposes, I created a simple Excel file:</p>
<img class='no-border' src='/static/images/excel2latex/sample_spreadsheet.png' />
<p>First things first: XLSX files are zipped, so we need to unzip the file first. Here&#8217;s the contents:</p>

<p><img alt='' src='/static/images/excel2latex/dir.png' /></p>

<p>What&#8217;s going on here? Lots of things.</p>

<p><em>Confession</em>: I didn&#8217;t read the spec. I figured all of this out by poking around the XML files&#8230;so I only understand a very small subset of the format :(</p>

<p>The only directory we care about is <span class='pre'>xl/</span>, where the data lives.</p>

<p>Here are the important files: <ul>
  <li><span class='pre'>xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml</span> - the data</li>
  <li><span class='pre'>xl/sharedStrings.xml</span> - table of strings</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Lets take a look at <span class='pre'>sheet1.xml</span>:</p>
<pre class='brush: xml'>
<sheetData>
    <row r='1' spans='1:2'>
        <c r='A1' t='s'>
            <v>4</v>
        </c>
        <c r='B1' t='s'>
            <v>3</v>
        </c>
    </row>
    <row r='2' spans='1:2'>
        <c r='A2'>
            <v>1</v>
        </c>
        <c r='B2' t='s'>
            <v>0</v>
        </c>
    </row>
    <row r='3' spans='1:2'>
        <c r='A3'>
            <v>2</v>
        </c>
        <c r='B3' t='s'>
            <v>1</v>
        </c>
    </row>
    <row r='4' spans='1:2'>
        <c r='A4'>
            <v>3</v>
        </c>
        <c r='B4' t='s'>
            <v>2</v>
        </c>
    </row>
</sheetData>
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s fairly obvious what&#8217;s going on here: <span class='pre'>&lt;row&gt;</span> denotes a row (with the r attribute being the number), <span class='pre'>&lt;c&gt;</span> is a column, and <span class='pre'>&lt;v&gt;</span> is a value.</p>

<p>But wait! Where are our previous letters and strings?! They certainly aren&#8217;t in any of the value tags!</p>

<p>Calm down. They&#8217;re safe and sound in <span class='pre'>sharedStrings.xml</span>.</p>

<p>Columns have a &#8220;t&#8221; attribute which denotes the data type. In the case of strings, we see <span class='pre'>t="s"</span>. This means we&#8217;ll be able to find the string in the string table at the index given to us in the v tag.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s in <span class='pre'>sharedStrings.xml</span>?</p>
<pre class='brush: xml'>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<sst count='5' uniqueCount='5' xmlns='http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main'>
<si>
    <t>A</t>
</si>
<si>
    <t>B</t>
</si>
<si>
    <t>C</t>
</si>
<si>
    <t>Letters!</t>
</si>
<si>
    <t>Numbars!</t>
</si>
</sst>
</pre>
<p>No explanation is really needed here.</p>

    <a href="/2012/10/27/my-toolchain.html"><h3 class="post-title">My Toolchain</h3></a>
    <h5 class="post-date">October 27, 2012</h5>
    <div class="post-content">
      <p>I run into quite a few articles on people&#8217;s blogs about the tools they use at their jobs. To me, it&#8217;s fascinating, since everyone takes a different approach, and more often than not I&#8217;ll walk away knowing about some new tool or trick that makes my life easier. I&#8217;ve always wanted to write one of these posts myself.</p>

<p>This whole post will probably get updated in the future as I continue tweaking things.</p>

<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve put waaaaaaay too much time into my development environment. I justify the lost time by saying something along the lines of &#8220;if I&#8217;m going to be staring at it all day, it had better look nice, damnit,&#8221; or I pretend I hadn&#8217;t just spent the last hour tweaking my .vimrc to fix some minor annoyance rather than getting work done.</p>

<h3 id='config_files'>Config Files</h3>

<p>I like to keep all of my config files in a <a href='http://github.com/eric-wood/dotfiles'>Github repo</a> for easy access. From any machine with git installed, I can simply clone the repository and run bootstrap.sh to have everything set up for me. The bootstrapping script backs up any duplicate dotfiles, and symlinks mine into my homedir.</p>

<p>My bash_profile and zshrc files, however, stay put and instead a line is appended to the beginning of the existing bash_profile or zshrc files to source the ones in the repo. This allows me to have system-specific settings in the file in my homedir along with my other customizations. Modularity is the name of the game!</p>

<h3 id='vim'>Vim</h3>

<p>Vim is awesome. After using it for a few years, I don&#8217;t think I can go back to other editors (unless they have a Vi mode, of course). I could probably do a separate blog post on my vimrc, but that&#8217;s not really necessary yet. You can take a peek at it <a href='https://github.com/eric-wood/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc'>here</a> if you&#8217;d like to get into the details, but I&#8217;ll give a brief overview of my customizations.</p>

<p>Before anything else, though, here&#8217;s a bitchin screenshot of my config in action:</p>
<a href='/static/toolchain/images/vim_demo.png'><img src='/static/images/toolchain/vim_demo.png' /></a>
<p>Now lets dig into the config a bit&#8230;</p>

<h4 id='colorschemes'>Colorschemes</h4>

<p>My tastes in colorschemes changes pretty often, so here&#8217;s a few of my favorites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme'>tomorrow-night-eighties</a> - my current fave</li>

<li><a href='http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized'>Solarized</a> - I have a keybinding to switch to the light version when I&#8217;m in the sun or have the brightness down</li>

<li><a href='http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2175'>Railscasts</a> - an old favorite, I come back to it from time to time</li>

<li><a href='https://github.com/tomasr/molokai'>Molokai</a> - also pretty neat</li>
</ul>

<h4 id='plugins'>Plugins</h4>

<p>First things first, I&#8217;d like to give a shout-out to <a href='https://github.com/gmarik/vundle'>Vundle</a>. It&#8217;s essentially a package manager for Vim plugins; you can search, install, and remove plugins from the comfort of Vim. It handles the messy stuff and makes it effortless to try out new plugins. I cannot recommend it enough.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;m on OS X most of the time, I use <a href='https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim'>MacVim</a> for everything. It&#8217;s wonderful and feels much better than gVim.</p>

<p>Quick note about terminal vs. gVim - when I can get my hands on it, I prefer gVim, <em>however</em> I do everything I can to make my vimrc work equally as well in both. The easiest way to do this is toggling functionality with an if statement. Some people prefer to have a separate gvimrc file with their gVim-specific settings (lame).</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s a list of some of my favorite plugins:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides'>Indent Guides</a> - little marks to help keep track of indents</li>

<li><a href='http://projects.mikewest.org/vimroom/'>Vimroom</a> - a Vim imitation of <a href='http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom'>Writeroom</a></li>

<li><a href='http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3736'>CtrlP</a> - fuzzy searching of buffers, filenames, etc.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658'>NERDTree</a> - the classic Vim file browser</li>
</ul>

<h4 id='other_customizations'>Other Customizations</h4>

<p>Everything else you see in my vimrc is just handy little keystrokes (mostly using &#60;leader&#62;) for toggling things.</p>

<p>Like all hardcore Vim users, I&#8217;ve remapped the arrow keys to do nothing. HJKL or die! ;)</p>

<h3 id='terminal'>Terminal</h3>

<p>Like many *nix users, I spend a lot of my time in the terminal. Since I&#8217;m mostly using OS X, <a href='http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iterm2.com%2F&amp;ei=MFaNUPriOsjXqgGM04DYDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7IStoNOzSPwdmFLWs4251hvTXvA'>iTerm2</a> is my terminal emulator of choice. It&#8217;s more flexible than Terminal.app, and can do things like splits and a cool FPS-style dropdown window.</p>

<p>I use the <a href='https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme'>tomorrow-night-eighties</a> iTerm2 colorscheme to match my Vim colorscheme.</p>

<p>Although it doesn&#8217;t happen as often anymore, when I find myself working remotely I like to use tmux. Right now I have it set up fairly similar to screen, since it feels more natural that way and there&#8217;s less confusion when I&#8217;m forced to use screen instead.</p>

<h4 id='zsh'>Zsh</h4>

<p>Recently I made the switch from bash to zsh. The reason? I had heard that zsh a Vi mode that <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> suck. I tried using Vi mode with bash for a while, but there was no way to figure out what state I was in. Zsh, however, lets you change the prompt accordingly.</p>

<p>Like all good zsh users, I&#8217;ve tricked out my prompt. Here it is in action:</p>
<a href='/static/images/toolchain/zsh.png'><img class='no-border' src='/static/images/toolchain/zsh.png' /></a>
<p>The important parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hostname is in blue</li>

<li>Current Git branch is in the square brackets</li>

<li>The lightning bolt: yellow = insert mode; blue = normal mode (for the Vi stuff)</li>

<li>Branch name changes from green to red when there are uncommitted changes</li>

<li>The red bar on the right helps me find my place when reading through scrollback</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='other_stuff'>Other stuff</h3>

<p>These don&#8217;t really need their own categories, but they definitely deserve some recognition:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://alfredapp.com'>Alfred</a> - very extensible launcher / everything utility. Love it.</li>

<li><a href='http://chrome.google.com'>Chrome</a> - the most advanced browser available. Web Inspector and I get along well.</li>

<li><a href='http://6xq.net/projects/pianobar/'>Pianobar</a> - open source CLI Pandora client. Shameless plug: I&#8217;ve got a <a href='https://github.com/eric-wood/pianobar-growl'>script</a> for Growl notifications with it. You should check it out.</li>

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>That&#8217;s a really good question. I don&#8217;t know yet. Mostly, it&#8217;s a fun little side project and a chance to flex some CSS muscles that have been a bit dormant as of late.</p>

<p>My intention is to write about whatever I think people should know about. It might be an opinion I need to share, or maybe some information on a problem I solved.</p>

<h3 id='technical_details'>Technical details</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href='http://pages.github.com'>Github Pages</a> to host everything for <a href='http://ericwood.org'>ericwood.org</a>. The other day I was reading about <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a>, which pages happens to support. Unlike other blogging things, Jekyll lets me roll my own everything, while taking care of the nasty parts like pagination and templating. This pleases me greatly.</p>

<p>Everything you see here was done from scratch, with the exception of some of the backend things Jekyll takes care of. The footer has a link to the source for this site if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing.</p>
